I went with a dark background for the header and footer  to give the site a modern, high-contrast appearance. This design choice helps the navigation links and footer content stand out, while also giving the website a bold and clean identity.

Hero Section with Background Image
For the hero section, I used a full-width background image with a subtle dark overlay. This not only adds visual impact but also ensures the white text is readable and centered. I wanted this section to create a strong first impression and immediately draw attention.

I focused on making the typography bold and readable. I used line breaks (<br>) strategically to control flow and emphasis. The font sizes are also responsive, ensuring they scale properly across different devices for better visibility.

 Product Grid
To showcase products effectively, I implemented a responsive layout using either Bootstrap’s grid system or custom flex/grid styling. The grid holds four product cards that adjust to screen size. Each card includes a product image, name, short description, and a “Shop Now” call-to-action button.


Consistent Card Design
I gave all product cards a unified style using padding, soft shadows, and border-radius for a clean, approachable feel. I also considered adding hover effects to make the cards more interactive and engaging for users.


Informative Footer
I structured the footer into three sections: About, Quick Links, and Contact. This layout helps users easily find essential information, and it stays true to the site’s overall dark theme and modern feel.
